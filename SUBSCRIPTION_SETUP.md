# Subscription Billing Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up subscription billing for the SaaS platform using Stripe.

## üéØ Overview

The subscription billing system includes:
- **Free Plan**: Always available, no payment required
- **Pro Plan**: $29/month subscription with enhanced features
- **Enterprise Plan**: Coming soon (greyed out, disabled)

## üõ† Setup Steps

### 1. Stripe Configuration

1. **Create Stripe Account**
   - Sign up at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
   - Complete account verification

2. **Create Products and Prices**
   ```bash
   # In Stripe Dashboard > Products
   # Create a new product:
   # Name: "Pro Plan"
   # Description: "Monthly subscription for Pro features"
   # Price: $29.00 USD (monthly)
   # Copy the Price ID (starts with price_)
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables**
   ```env
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..." # or sk_live_ for production
   STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_..." # or pk_live_ for production
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_..."
   STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID="price_..." # Copy from Stripe Dashboard
   ```

### 2. Database Setup

1. **Run Database Migration**
   ```bash
   npx prisma db push
   ```

2. **Verify Schema Changes**
   - User table now has `plan` column (default: FREE)
   - New Subscription table for tracking subscriptions
   - Payment table updated for subscription payments

### 3. Webhook Configuration

1. **Set up Stripe Webhook**
   - In Stripe Dashboard > Webhooks
   - Add endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/stripe/webhook`
   - Select events:
     - `customer.subscription.created`
     - `customer.subscription.updated`
     - `customer.subscription.deleted`
     - `checkout.session.completed`
   - Copy webhook secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### 4. Testing

1. **Development Testing**
   - Use test route: `POST /api/stripe/test`
   - Body: `{ "action": "upgrade", "plan": "PRO" }`
   - This simulates subscription without Stripe charges

2. **Stripe Test Cards**
   - Use Stripe test cards for checkout testing
   - Card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Any future expiry date and CVC
